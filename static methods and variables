/* 1. static variables are also known as Class Variables
2. static methods are also known as Class methods
3.static variables are lazyly initialized
  they are not initialixed until they are used in program
  so they consume memory only  when they are used
  
  static methods has nothing  to do with class object or instance 
  you cannot use this keywords within a static methods
  
  from a static method
  you can only access static method and static variables
  but you cannot access normal instance variable and methods of the class
